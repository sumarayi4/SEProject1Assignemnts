        <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
		<p>
			My hobbies revolve around both physical and mental activities. One of my favorite sports is cricket. I enjoy playing with friends on weekends, practicing my batting and bowling skills. Cricket not only keeps me active but also allows me to strategize and work as part of a team. Another sport I love is badminton. It's a fast-paced game that improves my reflexes and agility. Playing badminton is a great way to stay fit and have fun at the same time. In addition, I am passionate about chess. The strategic and intellectual challenges of chess captivate me. I enjoy analyzing my opponents' moves and coming up with plans to outsmart them. These hobbies keep me engaged and offer a balanced mix of physical and mental exercise.
